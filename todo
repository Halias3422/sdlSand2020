HANDLE CONTENT ON SCREEN

int array of int array pointing on an "object informations" structure for each pixel on the screen
at the launch of the program each existing visual object is buffered to analyze from its colors and position
of other pixels around to check for angle


point to every pixel of existing objects in chain to quickly modify needed pixels and loop on it until all movements are made

make sand pixel fall until it hits the ground or other sand pixel

if pixel felt on top of other lonely pixel it drops to the right or left depending
on velocity (random at first)
